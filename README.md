# weather-scraper

scrapes the high and low forecasts off accuweather
so you don't have to OPEN A NEW PAGE FOR EVERY SINGLE WEEK

1. a procrastination project
2. maybe a gardening aid
3. a refresher on scraping

It'd be cool to make plot the highs and lows over time. Maybe I'll do that.

## Dependencies:
- `requests`
- `bs4`
- `re` I guess
